        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        </ul>
        
		
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy-bottomed pan till it starts foaming; immediately add the lime juice and stir. It will curdle right away. You should see the milk solids (chenna) separate from the whey. Pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth; rinse the chenna with cold water to get rid of the lime juice. Allow the water to drain completely.</li>
            <li>Gather the muslin cloth edges like a parcel and express as much water as possible; what you now have is soft paneer. Turn the paneer onto a rolling mat or other smooth surface. Knead the paneer well to make a smooth paste. Roll into a ball and divide into 20 equal portions.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil in a pressure cooker; stir the sugar into the boiling water until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Roll each portion of paneer into a smooth ball between your palms, making sure there are no cracks; gently drop the balls into the hot syrup. Secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and bring to pressure. Reduce heat to medium-low and pressure cook for 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Release the pressure from the cooker while running under water; remove the lid. The rasgullas should be floating on the syrup and have expanded 2 or 3 times in size. Pour the rasgullas and syrup into a bowl. Gently stir the cardamom into the mixture. Refrigerate to chill completely before serving cold.</li>
		</ol>
